The data was imbalanced so it was sampled using oversampling technique smote.

Done Feature engineering to select most relevant features ,analysed the correlation dropped unwanted features.

SUPPORT VECTOR CLASSIFIER is selected has the generalized model for given problem since it gives 91% for training and 84% for testing accuracy with a gap of only 7% compare to other models
